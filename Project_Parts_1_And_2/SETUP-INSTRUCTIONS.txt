I created this app using nrwl and an environment I am familiar with from an internship 
because I thought I could make a somewhat decent UI.

I'm not sure if you have experience with apps of this type so it may be a bit tricky to run.
This File will walk you through how to successfully run the app. Please email me with questions! bpashia@hawk.iit.edu

Step One: clone my github repository from https://bitbucket.org/bpashia/cs425brocpashia/admin

Step Two: Create a database
    - I used postgres like the labs to perform the following operations
    - Create a database named "Airline"
    - In my project repo, there is a folder called Project_Parts_1_And_2. 
      Open the file in this folder called cs425-app-sample-data.sql
    - Run the sql scripts to create tables and populate sample data

Step Three: Run the app
    - open two terminal windows
    - in both terminals, cd into the repository directory (cs425brocpashia)
    - run yarn in the command line to install packages (simply type 'yarn' if installed. May have to install yarn)
    - in the first terminal, run the comman "nx serve api"
    - in the second terminal, just run "nx serve"

Step four: Using the app
    - go to localhost:4200 in browser
    - the demo video will give an outline of the UI
    - Enjoy!

Thanks professor for the semester! :)
